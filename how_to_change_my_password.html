			<h2>Some suggestions for a good & strong password</h2>

			<p>A good password is something easy for you to remember, but difficult for others to guess.
			It is not recommend to use this kind of passwords:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A word from the company/workplace</li>
				<li>A memorable date</li>
				<li>A simple sequence of numbers or characters (eg "123456" or "qwerty")</li>
			</ul>

			<p>It is better to use a combination of letters and characters in lower and upper case.
			Some punctuation marks or special characters may be used, for example:</p>

			<pre>1AmTheBest@nEarth!
			</pre>
